# Apply for Unemployment Insurance
Any federal employee who is let go as part of the wave of layoffs or firings can apply for Unemployment Compensation for Federal Employees (UCFE).

# File an Appeal
* **Try replying with evidence of your performance**: if your termination letter cited poor performance, e.g. "the Agency finds that you are not fit for continued employment because your ability, knowledge and skills do not fit the Agency’s current needs, and your performance has not been adequate to justify further employment at the Agency.", reply attaching evidence of your actual performance such as PMAP reviews, written feedback from your supervisor, or awards you've received.

* [Civil Service Strong: U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB): How to File an Appeal](https://www.civilservicestrong.org/resource/us-mspb-how-to-file-an-appeal) Federal employees who are not in their probationary period have the right to file an appeal to the MSPB. The primary function of the MSPB is to protect Federal merit systems against partisan political and other prohibited personnel practices.

# Consider Legal Action
## Class Actions
* [Democracy Forward: Federal Workers File Class-Wide Complaint Challenging Mass Terminations with Office of Special Counsel](https://democracyforward.org/updates/federal-workers-file-class-wide-complaint-challenging-mass-terminations-with-office-of-special-counsel/): Democracy Forward is working with the [Alden Law Group](https://www.employmentlawfederal.com/).

* [James & Hoffman](https://www.jamhoff.com/) is exploring filing class or group claims on behalf of probationary employees affected by mass terminations. If people are interested in participating, they can send an email to inquiries@jamhoff.com. It would be helpful for them to include this information: (1) the name of the agency; (2) a copy of the termination notice; (3) whether the employee is part of a union bargaining unit, if they know.
