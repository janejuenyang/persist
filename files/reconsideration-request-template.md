To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing to formally contest my recent termination, which was attributed to “[COPY CAUSE LANGUAGE FROM YOUR TERMINATION NOTICE].” This reasoning appears inconsistent with my most recent performance review (attached), which rated my work as “[FILL IN BLANK]” and highlighted specific contributions and achievements.

(If applicable) My supervisor was never consulted regarding my performance and had no prior knowledge of this action. [SHE/HE] was only informed in an ad-hoc meeting on [DATE], shortly before letters were scheduled to be sent to affected staff. Given these circumstances, I respectfully request reconsideration of my termination. If there are specific concerns regarding my performance, I would welcome the opportunity to address them directly.

I remain committed to the mission of the federal government and [YOUR AGENCY] and believe my record reflects my dedication and value to the team. Please let me know if we can discuss this matter further. I would appreciate the opportunity to clarify any misunderstandings and explore the possibility of reinstatement.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
