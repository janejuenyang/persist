 Rebuttal Letter For Termination

[Your Name] [Your Address] [City, State, ZIP Code] [Your Email] [Your Phone Number] [Date]

To: [Agency Official’s Name] [Agency Name] [Agency Address] [City, State, ZIP Code]

[OPM Representative’s Name] Office of Personnel Management [OPM Address] [City, State, ZIP Code]

Subject: Request for Justification and Compliance with Regulations Regarding Probationary Termination

Dear [Agency Official’s Name] and [OPM Representative’s Name],

I am writing in response to the termination notice I received, which states that my removal is due to “performance issues.” However, the notice does not provide specific explanations regarding my alleged deficiencies or reference any supporting documentation from my employing agency. Given that this action appears inconsistent with the requirements set forth in federal regulations, I respectfully request clarification and a formal justification for this decision.

**Concerns Regarding Procedural Compliance**

As a probationary employee, I understand that my employing agency has the authority to terminate my appointment based on performance under 5 C.F.R. § 315.804 (see 5 C.F.R. § 315.804). However, this regulation establishes specific requirements that do not appear to have been fully followed in my case:

1. Written Notice Stating Specific Reasons for Termination • [5 C.F.R. § 315.804(a)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-5/chapter-I/subchapter-B/part-315/subpart-H/section-315.804) states that an agency must provide a probationary employee with “notice in writing as to why the employee is being separated.” The termination notice I received does not contain any specific reasons or evidence supporting the claim of “performance issues.”

2. Official Agency Documentation • Per [5 C.F.R. § 315.804(a)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-5/chapter-I/subchapter-B/part-315/subpart-H/section-315.804), an agency must have documented reasons supporting the termination of a probationary employee. I request copies of any relevant records, including performance evaluations, counseling records, and any prior warnings or notices provided to me.

**Role of OPM and Agency Responsibility**

I also seek clarification on whether my termination was initiated solely by my employing agency or if OPM has taken an active role in this decision. According to 5 C.F.R. § 315.804, it is my employing agency’s responsibility—not OPM’s—to take and justify termination actions. If OPM has issued this notice independently, I request an explanation of its authority to do so.

**Request for Justification and Due Process**

To ensure my rights are upheld, I respectfully request:

1. A clear and specific explanation of the performance deficiencies that led to my termination, as required by 5 C.F.R. § 315.804(a) (see 5 C.F.R. § 315.804).

2. Copies of any performance evaluations, counseling records, or other documentation used as the basis for my removal, per 5 C.F.R. § 315.804(b) (see 5 C.F.R. § 315.804).

3. Confirmation of whether my termination was initiated solely by my employing agency or if OPM played a role in this decision.

4. Information on my rights to respond or appeal, including whether I have recourse through the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) under 5 C.F.R. § 315.806 (see 5 C.F.R. § 315.806).

I believe that transparency and adherence to due process are essential in federal employment matters. I appreciate your prompt attention to this matter and look forward to your response.

Sincerely, [Your Name]

**Subject**: Request for Reconsideration of Termination

**To**: the email address provided in your termination notice for sending questions

**CC:** 
* Your supervisor
* Your supervisor's supervisor
* Your office's leadership
* Your agency's administration leads
* (If applicable) Union chapter representative and president
* Hampton Dellinger, Office of Special Counsel: info@osc.gov
* Your congressional representatives (house and senators) -- find them via [Congress.gov](https://www.congress.gov/members/find-your-member)

**Contents**

To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing to formally contest my recent termination, which was attributed to “[COPY CAUSE LANGUAGE FROM YOUR TERMINATION NOTICE].” This reasoning appears inconsistent with my most recent performance review (attached), which rated my work as “[FILL IN BLANK]” and highlighted specific contributions and achievements.

(If applicable) My supervisor was never consulted regarding my performance and had no prior knowledge of this action. [SHE/HE] was only informed in an ad-hoc meeting on [DATE], shortly before letters were scheduled to be sent to affected staff. Given these circumstances, I respectfully request reconsideration of my termination. If there are specific concerns regarding my performance, I would welcome the opportunity to address them directly.

I remain committed to the mission of the federal government and [YOUR AGENCY] and believe my record reflects my dedication and value to the team. Please let me know if we can discuss this matter further. I would appreciate the opportunity to clarify any misunderstandings and explore the possibility of reinstatement.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
