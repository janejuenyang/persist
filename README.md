# You're Not Alone
This repository includes resources for federal civil servants, including those wrongfully impacted, organized in buckets:

1. How to [stay prepared](prepare.md) during this moment in our democracy

2. How to [respond](respond.md) after wrongful termination

3. Support resources for [recovery](recover.md), mentally and financially

4. Ways to [report](report.md) wrongdoing

5. [Trackers](track.md) from credible sources on lawsuits, impacted staff, and administration actions

The information in this repo has been shared by many communities and individuals across multiple forums: thank you. Other folks have also put together consolidated resources. I'm listing them below because we all absorb information differently; use whatever resource makes most sense to the way your brain works.

* [Fed Layoffs](https://fedlayoffs.com/)

# Federal Oath of Office
I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign **and domestic**; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter. So help me God.
