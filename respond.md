# Consider Legal Action
*Note*: federal employees must exhaust their administrative remedies before going to court.

## Class Actions
* [Democracy Forward: Federal Workers File Class-Wide Complaint Challenging Mass Terminations with Office of Special Counsel](https://democracyforward.org/updates/federal-workers-file-class-wide-complaint-challenging-mass-terminations-with-office-of-special-counsel/): Democracy Forward is working with the [Alden Law Group](https://www.employmentlawfederal.com/).

* [James & Hoffman](https://www.jamhoff.com/) is exploring filing class or group claims on behalf of probationary employees affected by mass terminations. If people are interested in participating, they can send an email to inquiries@jamhoff.com. It would be helpful for them to include this information: (1) the name of the agency; (2) a copy of the termination notice; (3) whether the employee is part of a union bargaining unit, if they know.
