# File an Appeal
[Protect Democracy: Understanding the Termination of Federal Probationary Employees and Their Rights](https://protectdemocracy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Termination-of-Probationary-employees.pdf)

* **File a grievance report through your agency**: federal agencies have their own administrative grievance policies. Typically these outline how federal employees can file informal and formal grievance reports. (Deadline: varies by agency; example: [HHS Instruction 771-3](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/hr-resource-library-771-1.pdf)); generally within 15 days of notice)

* **If you were part of a reduction-in-force (RIF, referred to as a layoff in the private sector), review the attachments and your RIF notice letter carefully.** 
    * Respond via the email address provided in your RIF notice with any corrections that apply to you (e.g. PMAP, veterans preference, service comp date doesn’t match SF-50).
    * If you want to fight the RIF, meaning you would like to be reinstated, here are some questions to pursue:
        * What was the specific competitive area? Did it include a geographic component?
        * What is the competitive level? Is it only my grade and series or does something else go into the level, like geography?
        * [Additional suggested questions and language](https://docs.civictechstrong.org/s/7b0a4147-a921-469c-aee4-d340f632cc44) provided by Civic Tech Strong

* **Union Contracts**: Employees who are in a collective bargaining unit can also contact their union for guidance on any options under their collective bargaining agreement.

# Consider Legal Action
*Note*: federal employees must exhaust their administrative remedies before going to court.

## Class Actions
* [Democracy Forward: Federal Workers File Class-Wide Complaint Challenging Mass Terminations with Office of Special Counsel](https://democracyforward.org/updates/federal-workers-file-class-wide-complaint-challenging-mass-terminations-with-office-of-special-counsel/): Democracy Forward is working with the [Alden Law Group](https://www.employmentlawfederal.com/). Email Consultation@AldenLG.com.

* [James & Hoffman](https://www.jamhoff.com/) is exploring filing class or group claims on behalf of probationary employees affected by mass terminations. If people are interested in participating, they can send an email to inquiries@jamhoff.com. It would be helpful for them to include this information: (1) the name of the agency; (2) a copy of the termination notice; (3) whether the employee is part of a union bargaining unit, if they know.
