# Be Safe
* As always, don't do anything personal on your government-furnished equipment.
* Remember that everything done on your work channels (email, chat platforms) are not private. They can be accessed and read.
* Be extra aware of potential scams and phishing
* For personal communications, use encrypted messaging platforms like [Signal](https://signal.org/).
* Protect yourself from doxxing. Doxxing is when information about you, publicly available or secret, is shared for the purpose of causing harm.
